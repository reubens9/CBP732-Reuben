    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a paper recently published in the Biochemical Engineering Journal continuous fermentations were conducted with $Actinobacillus~succinogenes$ ($Succi$) and $Basfia~succiniciproducens$ ($Basfia$). The fermentations were conducted with xylose and a spent sulphite liquor (SSL) in order to determine which organism would produce higher titres of succinic acid. $Succi$ has been widely know to be a good producer of succinic acid however little is known about $Basfia$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In analysis of the paper is was determine that further insight could be obtain with analysis tools such as a metabolic flux analysis as well as mass and energy balances. In order to simplify the analysis only the continuous data from the xylose fermentations will be used. This was decided since the SSl sugar composition isn't fully known and to take multiple sugars into account in a flux analysis unknown variables are added that cannot be solved for."

    "### Succinic acid production via continuous fermentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper by Ladakis, Michailid, Vlysidis, Koutinas and Koutinas (2018) is was found that Basfia was able to produce higher concentrations of succinic acid at the dilution rates tested. The same concentration of xylose of 40 g/l was feed for all fermentations conducted at varied dilution rates. In Figure 1 below it can be seen that the highest production of succinic acid for both organisms was at a dilution rate of 0.04 1/h, after which the concentration decreased with an increase in dilution rate. $Succi$ (△) produces less succinic acid compared to $Basfia$ (▲).\n",

    "<center><h5> Figure 1: Comparison between the succinic acid production concentrations</center></h5>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Along with the production of succinic acid both organisms produce by products, for $Succi$ these include acetic acid and formic acid. $Basfia$ produces the same by products as $Succi$ as well as the addition of lactic acid. The products are however in lower concentrations than that of succinic acid. In Figure 2 the concentration profiles of these compound are shown. As the dilution rate increases the by products concentrations decrease for $Succi$ however with $Basfia$ they seem to increase.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Figure 3 shows that as the dilution rate was increased the amount of xylose consumed decreased. The reason for this can be that the dilution rate is approaching the maximum specific growth rates for both organisms. This results in less biomass in the reactor as can be seen in Figure 4 and a decrease in volumetric consumption of xylose.\n",

    "<h3>Mass balances</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyses the data fully it is necessary to determine if the mass balance is fully satisfied. The balance must take into account the substrates and products. In this case xylose, $NH_3$ are the reactants with $CO_2$ that functions both as a product and reactant. The products include all of the products specified above as well as water. Equation 1 and 2 show the chemical equations for $Succi$ and $Basfia$ respectfully. \n",

    "<center>$$Xylose + CO_2 + NH_3 → X + Succinic~ acid + Acetic ~acid  + Formic~ acid + Lactic~ acid~~~~(2)$$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Equations 3 and 4 show the chemical equations for $Succi$ and $Basfia$ respectfully with all the compound in a Cmol base.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center>$$CH_2O + CO_2 + NH_3 → CH_{1.896}O_{0.603}N_{0.258} + CH_{1.5}O + CH_2O + CH_2O_2 + H_2O~~~~~~(3)$$</center>\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "As can be seen in Equation 3 above the biomass formula is $CH_{1.896}O_{0.603}N_{0.258}$. This is the Cmol based biomass formula for $Succi$ as has been determined Lexow (2018). The biomass equation for $Basfia$ is unknown therefore the average biomass formula of $CH_{1.8}O_{0.5}N_{0.2}$ will be used in Equation 4. To solve the mass balance a carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen balances will be used with the known concentrations of xylose, succinic acid and byproducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Metabolic flux analysis</h3>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A goal of this analysis is to determine the differences between the metabolism and energy production of $Succi$ and $Basfia$. It is therefore required that we known the metabolic pathways of both these organism. Ladakis et al. (2018) was used to determine the pathway for $Basfia$ when xylose is the only substrate and Bradfield (2016) showed the pathways for $Succi$ on xylose. The metabolic pathways can be seen in Figures 5 and 6 for $Succi$ and $Basfia$ respectfully.\n",

In order to conduct a metabolic flux analysis the production rates of these compounds need to be determined. This is done with the following equations:\n",

    "Flux analysis were conducted to allow for the inner metabolic pathways to be quantified. This allows for a more detailed comparison between the two organism. The metabolic pathways for both the respective organisms as can be seen in Figures 5 and 6 were used to develop a rate matrix. The rate matrix consist of nodal balances, stoichiometric specifications, an NADH balance as well as rate specifications. The production and consumption rates of the specific components were calculated and then used as specifications to solve for the internal metabolic rates. It was found that the mass balances and metabolic flux models achieved the same solutions with negligible errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing the metabolic pathways it can be seen that the major difference between $Succi$ and $Basfia$ is the presence of the full tricarboxylic acid cycle in $Basfia$. This analysis enables us to determine to what extent this difference makes a impact in the metabolism of xylose. From Figure 1 it can be seen that $Basfia$ produces succinic acid in higher concentrations, this translates to higher rates of production as can be seen in Figure 7\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure above clearly shows that $Basfia$ is far more effective at producing succinic acid, possible causes for this is a greater production of NADH through the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle. If more NADH is produced then a greater NADH sink is required which will result in more succinic acid. This therefore is definatly part of the reason however may not be the complete reason. Since the internal metabolic fluxes have been determine its now possible to determine the ATP production as can be seen in Figure 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "This figure shows a very similar trend as shown in Figure 7. The ATP production is far greater for that of $Basfia$, this greater ATP production may enable $Basia$ more energy to pump succinate into the medium and therefore increase its succinate production. The reason for this similarity between Figure 7 and 8 may however, be far simpler. If one looks at the pathway used to produce succinate in $Basfia$ (Figure 6) it can be seen that if the reductive branch of the of the TCA cycle is used then ATP is produced along with succinic acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme is present in both $Succi$ and $Basfia$. This enzyme converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate with the consumption of $CO_2$. In Figure 9 it can be seen that this enzyme is far more active in $Basfia$ than in $Succi$. This explains both the higher succinic acid production as well as the ATP production rate.\n",

    "The increased activity of this enzyme should then also affect the amount of $CO_2$ that is consumed.

Figure 10 shows that the consumption of $CO_2$ is far greater for $Basfia$\n",

At some points $Basfia's$ xylose consumption is more than double that of $Succi$ at the same dilution rate. However, the question still hasn't been answered whether the oxidative branch in $Basfia$ is the cause of the higher succinate production rate. Figure 12 shows that all the succinate seems to be produced through the reductive branch and oxidative branches are inactive. This is possibly a means of the organism to optimise its metabolic pathways to produce succinic acid.\n",

    "\n",
    "It can clearly be seen that $Basfia$ is able to produce succinic acid at far higher rates than $Succi$. The mass balance as well as metabolic flux analysis has lead to believe that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme is more active in $Basfia$. This leads to more ATP being produced, more $CO_2$ being consumed and the higher production of succinic acid. It has also been seen that under these conditions of high succinate production the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle has been shutdown. All carbon is then channeled through the reductive pathways."
